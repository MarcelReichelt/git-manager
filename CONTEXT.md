# Git workspace manager

git-worktree-manager is the desktop app for one workspace at a time, with a checkout per branch. The window holds the open repository tabs.

The project is git-worktree-manager. It was renamed from git-manager.
docs/research/, .cursor/plans/, and .scratch/ still use the old name.
Do not rename them. The app does not read or write the old config paths
or the GIT_MANAGER_* environment variables.
